		I am a RIT gradute, majoring in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences. I have worked at a camp for adults
        with Intellectual and Developmental Disorders. I've worked there for three summers. I enjoy playing roleplay games
        such as Dungeon's and Dragons. I live in a small town on the shoreline of Connecticut called East Lyme.
