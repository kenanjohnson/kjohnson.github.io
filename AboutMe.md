        <p>
		I am a recent RIT graduate but I changed my major this semester from Computer Enginnering Technology to 
		Digital Humanities and Social Sciences. Over the summer I work at a camp for adults and children
		with intellectual and developmental disorders. This summer will be my second year working there.
		I have Crohn's Diease which is a chronic disease that affects my digestive system. I enjoy playing
		roleplay games such as Dungeon's and Dragons. I live in a small town on the shoreline of Connecticut called
		East Lyme.
