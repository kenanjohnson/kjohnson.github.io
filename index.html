				<p>
					I am a third year at RIT but I changed my major this semester from Computer Enginnering Technology to 
					Digital Humanities and Social Sciences. Over the summer I work at a camp for adults and children
					with intellectual and developmental disorders. This summer will be my second year working there.
					I have Crohn's Diease which is a chronic disease that affects my digestive system. I enjoy playing
					roleplay games such as Dungeon's and Dragons. I live in a small town on the shoreline of Connecticut called
					East Lyme.
